        <h2>Learner Circle's Know Your Child</h2>
        <p>A small step towards understanding your child better.</p>
        <p>This 28-item tool measures a child’s intelligence (6-15 years) across 7 intelligences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linguistic-Verbal</li>
            <li>Logical-Mathematical</li>
            <li>Visual-Spatial</li>
            <li>Bodily-Kinesthetic</li>
            <li>Interpersonal-Social</li>
            <li>Musical</li>
            <li>Naturalist intelligence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tool is developed on the basis of Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences proposed in 1983.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to Howard Gardner’s theory, multiple research literature in the area of intelligence has been
            taken into account to develop this tool. It is an initiative from Learner Circle to help parents understand
            the core strengths of their child through a proven-process.</p>
        <p>The survey will lead children towards their areas of natural aptitude and intelligence.</p>

        <h2>Important points to remember while taking the survey:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="important">Parents should not interfere with the choices selected by the child.</li>
            <li class="important">Parents should help, only if the child does not understand the question.</li>
            <li class="important">All questions have to be completed in one sitting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On submission, you will receive an email in 24 to 48 hours about the child's profile which will be analyzed
            and developed by our expert panel.</p>
        <p>You will also have an option to book a 15-minute appointment to have a discussion with a Child Psychologist
            after you receive the report.</p>
        <p>The results produced might vary on different days based on the mindset of the child or learning experience
            that they have gone through recently. The assessment is in no way a final report of your child. It's an
            indicative assessment done to enable parents to know their child better. Learner Circle is not responsible
            for any decision that the parent takes based on the survey.</p>
